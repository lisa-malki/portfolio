      <h1 class= 'my-4' >Project Overview</h1>
      <p>
        Invisible bytes of data shape the news we see online, the people we speak to, and the decisions made about us by the powers-that-be. Data is often too big for us to meaningfully comprehend, so must be abstracted: visualisation refers to the practice of encoding and abstracting information using graphical elements.  
      </p>
      <p>
        What we take from a visualisation is the culmination of several design decisions as the same data can be visually encoded in a myriad of different ways. A user-centred approach to visualisation takes into account the context of the end-user, the domain tasks they wish to achieve with a visualisation,
        and most importantly, their cognitive and perceptive capacities. The best encoding therefore, is that which is the most appropriate for the task at hand, and the user interpreting it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project explores some examples of user-centered data visualisation, presenting a fusion of well-known and newer vis idioms in everyday contexts. I use the language of domain tasks and targets to describe the aims of users, and describe the underlying visual principles guiding my choices of encoding.
      </p>
      
      <h1 class= 'mt-4'>Smart Thermostat</h1>
      <p class='lead'>
        This mini-project details the process of designing visualisations to be integraded into a domestic smart thermostat.
      </p>
      <h2 class='my-4'>
          Domain Tasks
      </h2>
      <p>
          Design decisions were made in relation to the following three domain tasks:
          <ol>
              <li>
                Checking that the smart thermostat is functioning correctly and efficiently: on a basic level, this involves an elementary
                lookup and comparison, where the target is an outlier, i.e. an instance where the temperature was not recorded or controlled as desired.
              </li>
              <li>
                Judging how the pattern of heating over time relates to activities in the home: This is a synoptic task , where
                the target may be any of: trends, outliers, or features.
              </li>
              <li>
                Checking that the temperature is within a safe range: For this task, the temperature is judged to be either
                under or over a known baseline, which can be set by the user. Targets include features and extremes/outliers.
              </li>
          </ol> 
      </p>
      <p>
        This projects uses two data streams for internal and external home temperature. The internal temperature data is a
        timestamped series of readings in degrees Celsius (samples taken every 10 minutes), with an additional categorical stream for boiler status (ON or OFF). The external
        temperature dataset has a similar structure and was scraped from WeatherUnderground (link <a href='https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/gb/london/EGLC/date/2017-3-10'>here</a>).
    </p>
      <h2 class='my-4'>
        Data Exploration
        </h2>

    <p>
        The tried and tested line chart idiom was chosen to initially visualise the temporal data. Line charts augment dot charts with connecting line marks, creating a very strong implication of trend relationships and
        continuous flow across points. Line graphs also use less screen real estate than bar charts - an important consideration given the high granularity of the data.
    </p>



    <h2 class='my-4'>
        Encoding Categorical Attributes
    </h2>
    <p>
        In addition to showing internal/external temperature, it is
        also desirable to indicate when the boiler is on and when
        the internal temperature falls below a defined limit. A full
        colour overlay was chosen to encode the boiler status.
        Colour is a relatively effective identity channel, and
        spatial overlay supports rapid comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
        Colour hue is additionally used as a visual popout to
        identify line segments which fall below an example
        baseline of 20 degrees. Due to parallel processing and
        the effectiveness of the colour channel in this context, the
        popout can be perceived even in the presence of other
        visual distractors.

        Interactivity and Context of Use
    </h2>
    <p>
        Interactive features improve the user experience of visualisations at little cost
        to accuracy or efficiency, and tooltips in particular improve user confidence
        when navigating time series charts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Zoom plots embed the time series within a zoomable widget allowing
        users to customise the timeframe they wish to see. Zooming was
        implemented using the Plotly Express library, which allows smooth, flexible
        navigation using a range slider as well as custom zooming on the main
        plot. Button filters to limit the view to common timeframes (1 month, 3
        months, 6 months) are also provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        Checkbox filters allow the user to select the graph amenities they wish to be visible. This
        enables them to view only the information that directly supports their task, eliminating
        distractors, and supporting the process of filtering.

    <h1 class= 'mt-5' >Screen Time Visualiser</h1>
    <p class='lead'>
        Being aware of how long we use our phones and for what purpose is becoming more popular, and many devices already have built-in visualisation displays for screen time, including total
        time spent, and breakdowns by app. This project will investigate how this data can be most effectively presented, given the constraints of a mobile interface.
    </p>
    <h2 class='my-4'>
        Domain Tasks
    </h2>
    <p>
        Design decisions were made in relation to the following three domain tasks:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Identifying the apps, or groups of apps, that take up the most screen time: this is a discovery task, the
                target of which is the distribution of screen time. Outliers and extremes are of particular interest.
            </li>
            <li>
                Checking how screen time (overall, or for specific apps) changes over time: this involves discovering
                temporal trends in the data at different levels of abstraction.
            </li>
        </ol> 
    </p>
    <p>
        I manually extracted my own app usage data for the period 8th-16th March 2022 from the iOS screen time app.
        The dataset is a 2D table, with entries representing screen time in minutes indexed by date and app name. Each
        app is categorized into social, entertainment, information, or other.
    </p>
    <h2 class='my-4'>
        Data Exploration: Visualising Temporal Trends
    </h2>

    <p>
        Bar charts facilitate accurate value extraction and efficient
        comparisons between adjacent (or close-together) bars. This is
        important, as domain task 2 focuses more on short-term, day-by-day
        trend comparisons rather than high-level changes over long
        periods of time. A stacked bar chart is used to show total screen
        time for each day of the week, disaggregated by app
        category.
    </p>
    
    

    <h2 class='my-4'>
        App-Wise Disaggregation
    </h2>
    <p>
        Core to the design is the task of checking screen time for individual apps, which are lower down on the hierarchy than app categories. 
         I initially designed a multiform interface
        which facets the stacked bar overview with a donut chart, expanding the range of
        tasks the user can complete peripherally. Each category is shown separately on
        a tabbed menu screen to reduce visual clutter. Donut charts effectively visualise hierarchical data with the arc length channel
        rather than the less perceptually salient angle.
    </p>
    <p>
        A downside of this approach is that users must switch
        between screens to view different categories, weakening the sense of implicit
        hierarchy in the data, and increasing cognitive load. Treemaps use subdivided,
        bounded areas to effectively convey hierarchical structures on displays of limited
        size without losing attention to detail.

        Interactivity and Context of Use

    <p>
        The final design combines the existing pattern of a labelled bar chart with a treemap, to disaggregate by category and app. When the user taps the bar
        corresponding to a particular day, an app-wise breakdown for that day appears. This facets a weekly overview with a treemap to keep weekly trends in the user's peripheral vision. The display includes descriptive text to support users who need screen-readers
        to interpret the visualisation

    <h1>Interactive Exhibit</h1>
    <p class='lead'>
        Datasets have become scientific artefacts, creating a place for museums exhibits which visualise data for a diverse audience. Here, I have designed an interactive museum
exhibition visualizing London’s atmospheric emissions and its relationship with borough demographics, allowing users to collaboratively explore data with a personal dimension.
    </p>
    <h2 class='my-4'>
        Domain Tasks
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Detecting global or local patterns in emissions across London, such as
            significant north-south or east-west differences in emissions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Identifying singular values for a chosen geographic location- e.g., viewing the rate of car
            ownership for one’s own borough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Searching for known patterns such as clusters and correlations between different
            demographical and environmental measures
        </li>

    </ol>
    <p>
        The data for this project includes a <a href='http://skgrange.github.io/data.html'>GeoJSON file</a> defining borough boundaries, and four additional streams of
        data for borough atmospheric emissions, population density car ownership, and percentage of green space taken
        from the <a href='https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-borough-profiles'>GLA borough profiles</a>.

    </h2>
    <h4 class='my-4'>
        Choropleth Map
    </h4>
    <p>
        Choropleth maps directly convey shape information by spatial elements, and use
        colour to encode associated ordinal, quantitative or categorical attributes. There is an
        intuitive concordance between the frequent aggregation of data at regional levels and the
        use of geometric regions to encode this data. Choropleths also
        exploit human colour perception through for instance, the dark-is-more bias. This means that even
        without a legend, high values are implicitly associated with dark colours.
    </p>

    <h4 class='my-4'>
        Colourmaps
    </h4>
    <p>
        The choice of colourmap rests on the structure and form of the data.
        Atmospheric emissions is quantitative, ranging from a (theoretical) minimum of
        zero, to some maximum. Consequently, making a multi-hue colourmap is
        inappropriate, as hue, an identity channel, does not carry an inherent message
        of magnitude.
    </p>
    <p>
        To better convey perceptual linearity, the luminance channel is used to show
        progression from a minimum to a maximum with a single-hue, monotonically
        increasing map. Five colour classes were used to provide sufficient granularity
        to explore trends without harming the
        map’s legibility, given the range of the
        emissions data. The <a href='https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3'>ColorBrewer</a> tool was used to experiment with
        different colourmaps, and select one that was suitable for colour blind users.

        Visualising Relationships
    </h2>
    <h4 class='my-4'>
        The Humble SPLOM
    </h4>
    <p>
        Scatterplots are particularly effective for visualising correlations between
        two variables, using perceptual judgements of how well points fall along a
        diagonal line. The rectilinear layout is familiar to users- an important
        factor, since museum exhibits are viewed by people of all skill levels.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs) are a good way to lay out multi-dimensional data, and outperform idioms such as parallel plots in correlation identification tasks. They are also more intuitive to novice users, and avoid the clutter
        caused by overlapping line segments.
    </p>
    <p>
        As such, relationships between various socio-demographic measures for boroughs in London was visualised using a SPLOM. The Seaborn library was used to
        implement a SPLOM with point grouping (enclosing
        points into geographical shapes) to make clusters,
        correlations, and outliers more visually salient.

        Large-scale displays reap the benefits of a wide field of view, which exploits
        peripheral vision to make sense of context while maintaining acuity of the focal
        area. They also encourage physical, embodied interaction such as walking and
        head turning, which improves user experience. A larger display which invites
        shared exploration of data is particularly important in museums, where people
        collectively make sense of exhibits.

        user taps a borough, it is highlighted, and points corresponding to this borough in
        the SPLOM are all enlarged and highlighted, so the user can see the matrix-wide
