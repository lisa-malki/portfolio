          <p class="lead " style='color:white'>An AR intervention designed to foster valuable experiences between
            co-located museum visitors. Submitted as an entry to the 2021 SNAP Creative Challenge.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class='container my-5'>
      <h1 class='my-4'>Project Overview</h1>
      <p>
        Museums are places of learning, joy, surprise, and perhaps most importantly, connection with others.
        Despite socialisation being a key motivation behind visiting the museum for many people, the social potential of museums has not been fully unlocked, in part due
        to the one-way information transfer model which pervades the design of exhibits. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Theorising that AR could disrupt this transmission-absorption model through allowing visitors to virtually transform the exhibition space, I led a team of six HCI students
        in developing ‘Paint Me’: a statue-painting intervention designed to promote interactive experiences between museum goers, while deconstructing
        historical misconceptions about the use of colour in statues from antiquity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this multidisciplinary project, we combined insights from museum studies, history, HCI, and art to design a proof-of-concept prototype with demonstrable potential for future development.
      </p>
      <h2 class='my-4'>Design Questions</h2>

      <p style='font-style:italic' class='lead'>
        How might we use AR to create an exhibit space that stimulates interest in history, and organically
        encourages socialisation?
      </p>
      <p style='font-style:italic' class='lead'>
        How might we ensure technology fits seamlessly into the exhibit space and augments, rather than replaces, historical artefacts?
      </p>

      <p style='font-style:italic' class='lead'>
        How might we encourage embodied interactions with museum exhibits while respecting the heritage of artefacts, and ensuring their safety?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class='container my-5'>
      <h1 class='my-4'>User Research</h1>
      <h2 class='my-4'>Passive Observations</h2>
      <p>
        To gain a high-level understanding of how visitors move through exhibit spaces and interact with one another, we conducted a passive field observation in the British Museum. 
        Our observation revealed the centrality of closely bonded visitor groups: lone visitors were rare,
        and high levels of discussion were observed within groups. This introduced a design
        challenge in bringing strangers together while still capitalising on the strong internal dynamics of visitor groups.
      </p>


      <h3 class='my-4'>Surveys and Interviews</h3>
      <p>
        Through conducting an exploratory online survey, we identified our target audience as 18-25 year olds with a moderate to strong interest in going to the museum, and some willingness to try out AR technologies in an exhibit space.
      </p>
      <p>
        We abstracted our survey findings into descriptive user personas, to act a single point of reference for future design decisions and foster empathy with our users.
      </p>

            </figure>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We also conducted in-depth interviews with a sample of participants who had been situated within the primary persona. The interviews explored how participants experienced the museum space, any frustrations they encountered, and their feelings towards the introduction of 
        AR technologies. We used affinity diagrams to analyse our findings inductively, and formulated a number of high-level themes which would shape our design process. 
        <h2 class='my-4'> Key Insights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While participants did report socialising with their groups, they generally expressed reluctance to extend this interaction to strangers, citing awkwardness, and feeling unknowledgeable
            about a particular historical period as justifications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Connection with the past was identified as multi-sensory, and driven by rich, relatable narratives about real people. Many
            participants had previously formed new historical interests through music and games, emphasising the value of
            immersive experiences with a low knowledge entry level.
          </li>
          <li>
            Participants expressed interest in using AR technologies to engage with exhibits on a deeper level, but were anxious about being overly immersed and bumping into and distracting others.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h1 class='my-4'>Sketching and Ideation</h1>
      <h2 class='my-4'>Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Feedback from users provided inspiration for design concepts, which were rapidly sketched in an unstructured
        brainstorming session. We focused on immersive concepts that promoted collaborative storytelling, and provided opportunities for embodied group interactions. 
      </p>
      <figure class="figure my-4 ">
        <img style='width:100%' src="images/paint me/sketches.jpg " alt="... ">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption ">Concept sketches for design alternatives</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The British Museum was selected as a case study due to its proximity to campus and its wide array of
        popular artefacts such as the Rosetta Stone. We eventually converged on our painting activity as it offered the strongest augmentation within the spatial context of the British Museum.
        Allowing users to virtually 'paint' statues in an exploratory way would offer a transformation of the real exhibit, as well as an opportunity to learn about how Roman and Greek
        painters worked in a hands-on way. 
      </p>

      <h2 class='my-4'>Conceptually Developing 'Paint Me'</h2>
      <figure class="figure my-4 ">
        <img style='width:100%' src="images/paint me/storyboard.jpg " alt="... ">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption ">An initial storyboard for the core functionality of 'Paint Me'</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This high-level concept was expanded into an activity in which 2-4 users would use an AR headset to digitally 'paint' a Greco-Roman statue with their hands. A HoloLens 2 headset was selected as the platform, due to its wide field of view, which was thought to facilitate peripheral awareness of other users.
      </p>
      <p>
        We introduced the key constraint of limiting the initial range of colours each user was given, to encourage social interactions. Each user would start off with a different set of initial colours, and would be able to see the colours on other users' palettes, sharing colours through gestural interactions. This introduced an element of teamwork, where users had to socialise if they wanted their painting to be historically accurate. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We produced a use case diagram to modularise the intervention into the key actions a single user would perform.
        This was extended into a user-centred journey map, to concretely relate our design to our primary persona.
      </p>

        <img style='width:100%' src="images/paint me/user journey.jpg " alt="... ">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption ">Initial user journey map for the intervention.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h1 class='my-4' >Tangible Mockups and Formative User Feedback</h1>
      <p>
        To explore the physicality of the design, we used scale paper models to experiment with different spatial layouts. Using paper characters, we stepped through all stages of the user journey as a group and were able to
        identify points of frustration for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our scale model prototype fed into the second iteration of our design- a tangible throwaway mockup, for use in
        evaluations. We selectively prototyped the core use cases with watercolours, coloured rocks, post-it notes and an iPad,
        and devised research questions to express our evaluation aims:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Does colour sharing encourage social interaction between users who don’t know each other?
          </li>
          <li>
            What motivates participants to continue with (or complete) the painting task?
          </li>
          <li>
            Given inexperience with a painting interface, what learning strategies are adopted by participants? How can
            we design for these learning strategies?
          </li>

        </ol>
      </p>

            Wizard-of-oz Testing
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our first test aimed to evaluate the social potential of the intervention, and observe the gestural interactions between novice users. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, we employed a wizard-of-oz technique. Participants were given two items each that represented the raw
            materials with which they would make their paints. High-level instructions such as “turn these rocks into paint”
            were given, allowing us to observe the most intuitive ways of interacting with the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our participants instinctively performed a crushing motion, and were rewarded with watercolour paints. They then set to work painting a prototypal 
            statue using watercolour paints, while we observed.

          Digital Painting
        </h2>
        <P>
          The second study aimed to observe the interaction styles of users who were unfamiliar with digital painting interface.
        </P>
        <p>
          We digitally prototyped the task of finger painting a statue using a propped-up iPad and the
          software Procreate. Our participant was instructed to begin painting in a free-form manner, and was not given a specific task to complete. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The process was subject to trial and error: at one point, the participant
          attempted to create a purple colour by laying a red stroke over a blue one, but expressed that the result was not what
          they originally pictured. At this point, the facilitator made the smudge tool available, allowing the participant to blend
          colours effectively after undoing their previous stroke.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 class='my-4'>
        Core Findings
      </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Participants in the first study were keen to initially instigate a trade, with this action sparking more conversations, including the consultation of one another on how to
            paint the statue. Though conducted with a small and non-representative sample, this provided some evidence of the inherently interpersonal nature of the task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Participants across both studies cited being able to take a photo of and share their work on social media as a key motivation for completing the tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Participants across both studies engaged in exploratory learning, and adopted a trial-and-error approach to using the interfaces. This suggested that timely feedback and recoverability was important, and that users should be encouraged to explore the interface rather than being overloaded with detailed instructions.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class='my-4'>
      <h1 class='my-4'>High-fidelity Video Prototype</h1>
      <figure class="figure ">
        <img style='width:100%' src="images/paint me/visual abstract.png " alt="... ">
        
      </figure>
      <p>
        Having consolidated our user feedback, we finalised the gesture language with which users would control the interface. We also designed a minimal onboarding procedure, which consisted of
        timely visual prompts which appeared in the user's field of view and instructed them on how to proceed. These prompts were linked to eyegaze fixations detected by the HoloLens eye-tracking system.
        For instance, if a participant fixated on another user of the system, a visual dialog instructing them on how to share paints would appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having finalised the featureset of our design, we conducted a high-fidelity video prototype using Adobe After Effects and the HoloLens 2 point-of-view camera tool. Our prototype visualised the full range of interactions and gestures available to the user, and illustrated the their journey through the exhibit. The prototype was
        designed at a level of fidelity sufficient for future evaluations, and focused on giving a narrative account of the experience.

        <h1 class='mb-4'>Outcome</h1>
        <p>
          We presented our video prototype to a purposive sample of participants in a final round of user testing, to gain high-level feedback on our concepts.  Participants responded favourably to the intervention overall, with one stating that it was “fun and impressive.” Some said they would use the activity to
          meet new people in the museum, but most participants preferred the idea of painting with their friends. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our visual cues made it clear that colour sharing was possible and most participants understood the process, but others expressed confusion as to why colour sharing would be necessary. In future, we would make the limited number of initial colours clearer to participants. Some users struggled to predict the effect of performing the colour share gesture though we theorise that the video prototype’s fidelity may have contributed to this. In the real activity, users would immediately see the new colour appear on their 
          palette with accompanying audio feedback. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the intervention has demonstrable value as a fun and joyful activity for co-located visitors. Next steps would include prototyping the proof-of-concept for the HoloLens SDK, and evaluating it in context.
