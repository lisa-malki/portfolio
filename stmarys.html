          <p class="lead " style='color:white'>A short UX case study focusing on redesigning the website of a local landmark church to bolster its online presence following lockdown</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class='container my-5'>
      <h1 class='my-4' >Project Overview</h1>
      <p>
        With the onset of lockdown, many faith communities are turning to the internet to maintain contact and hold services. I redesigned the desktop website of a local landmark church
        with a particular focus on information architecture and presentation. The site attracts a steady number of new visitors, so as well as catering
        to the community, it also needs a clear and informative homepage which emphasises key information.
      </p>

      <p>
        This redesign has been conducted on a voluntary basis over the past few months. I am currently in the process of updating the live St. Mary's website to reflect the design changes, which can be found <a href='https://www.stmarysharrow.org.uk/'>here.</a> The next stage of the process would be to gather feedback on
        the UI styling once the UX improvements are actioned.
      </p>
      

    </div>
    <div class='container my-4'>
      <h1 class='my-4'>User Research</h1>
      <h3 class='my-4'>Interviews and Observations </h2>
        <p>
            To ensure the design was grounded in the needs of users and sensitive to their
            existing habits, I formulated three core research questions which would guide
            the process:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    What do users generally access the website for? What are their goals?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How easily are users able to complete their goals?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What challenges and pain points do users experience?
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            To shed some light on these questions, I conducted a remote observation with
            three regular users of the website, and one user who had never used the site,
            but had used other church websites. Users were encouraged to think-aloud as
            they browsed. Design themes were constructed through affinity diagramming,
            and a user journey map was created to visualise the flow through the website
            relative to the users’ goals, emphasising any reported challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was clear from the analysis that the key usability problems were related to the site's information architecture. More specifically:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Regular users primarily use the website to find
                    information about upcoming events.
                </li>
                <li>
                    New users instinctively seek out contact details,
                    but struggle to find them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users miss important information if it is obscured
                    behind unrelated links or dense text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users are more likely to access information that is
                    visible on the homepage or top level navbar.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

          <h1 class='my-4'> Sketching Alternatives </h1>
          <p>
            I then analysed a number of existing church websites to understand what users would
            expect when browsing the site. I inspected five websites, and made notes on the
            homepage, services, and events page, before identifying patterns which worked well
            across sites. This served as useful inspiration for design alternatives for the homepage and services page, which were rapidly sketched.
          </p>
          <h2 class='my-4'>
              Homepage Macrostructures
          </h2>
          <p>
            I developed three core concepts for an improved homepage, focusing on the high-level page architecture. I experimented with vertical and horizontal navigational menus,
            and different spatial layouts for page elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key design aim was to make the site contact details more visually prominent, and offer an appropriate preview of the church's services and events while reducing visual clutter.

            Medium-Fidelity Prototyping
          </h1>
          <h2 class='my-4'>
            Home and Services Page
          </h2>
          <p>
            I selected the strongest concepts to wireframe in medium-fidelity using Adobe
            XD. Designs which prompted visibility of information and flexibility were
            prioritised, allowing me to narrow the design space to two homepage alternatives,
            a services page, and a sermons page. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I then conducted remote usability tests to compare the two designs. Users were sent a link to the interactive prototype, and observed over zoom as
            they navigated the site. Each participant was invited to browse both versions (A then
            B) before completing a brief post-task interview. I inferred usability insights from their
            observed actions, their stated points of frustration, and overall impressions. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Key observations included:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Users rarely scrolled to the footer before navigating away from the homepage,
                suggesting that putting contact details in the footer might not be valuable.
              </li>
              <li>
                When watching videos on YouTube, users remarked that they liked to peripherally browse content on
                the page around and underneath the video player– making a modal unsuitable for sermon livestreams.
              </li>
              <li>
                Homepage A was perceived to be easier to use, less cluttered,
                and more informative than B across participants.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally, users preferred homepage A over B, and were better able to navigate to key 
            pages such as services and contact on the former. It was also decided that embedding videos in a separate page rather than appearing as a modal overlay would better support peripheral browsing.

            Outcomes
          </h1>
          <p>
            The redesign has improved the information architecture, usability, and aesthetic appeal of the site. Content is visible and organised in a way that
            is logical, and intuitive to find. I grounded my
            design criteria in the needs of users, and
            conducted research into existing church
            websites to develop a UI vocabulary which
            was familiar to users. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently implementing the new features and designs on the live site, and will soon focus my attention on the mobile UI. This will involve a dedicated sketching and prototyping
            session, as the X can be affected significantly by the size of the viewport.
